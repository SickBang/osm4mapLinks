# osm4mapLinks

This Firefox add-on shall encourage the use of non-commercial map solutions. Many websites link to map services such as Google Maps in order to show directions to a place. Instead, it would be great to show the requested location by OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap(OSM) is a good alternative, since it is community-driven and has an open database. The osm4mapLinks add-on finds all map links on a website directing to Google, Bing, Yahoo and replace them with links to OpenStreetMap.
